# 0X0C - Web Server


Web servers consist of hardware and software that use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to respond to web usersâ€™ requests made via the World Wide Web.

__NOTE__: In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

1. Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
2. Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention).
